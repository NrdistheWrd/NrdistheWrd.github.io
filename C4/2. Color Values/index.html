                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p> Hexadecimal is like a "code" for outputting a certain color using the hash and a combination of any 6 numbers or letters. RGB, on the other hand is much easier to invision. It is an acronym for "Red, Green Blue" and uses any combination of nummbers from 0 to 255. The higher the number of one of these 3 colors, the more concentration there is of it. Lastly, HSL is similar to RGB in that it is an acronym for "hue, saturation, lightness", but uses degrees and percentages of these parameters to create the color. </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: I prefer to use hexadecimal code because it is not as many characters so its a tiny bit quicker and easier to remember</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>WWB stands for "hue, whiteness, blackness" with hue having a range of 0 to 360. The white and black is 0 to 100 and change the overall tone of the main "hue" color. </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK stands for "Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black" and is primarily used with designs, especially those that will be printed. This is because printers have these 4 colors at their disposal during printing.</p>
